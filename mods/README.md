# Miscellanious Lua Mods

A bunch of smaller mods I've worked on, either to put concepts into action or API testing.

Any mods with "Raw File" rather than "Download" next to them require you to press `Ctrl + S` when going onto the page to download

## [CS] Bouncy Icons - [Raw File](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Squishy6094/misc-mods-coop/main/mods/cs-bouncy-icons.lua)
An Add-on/Extension for Character Select that was made for API testing, This mod gets every icon available in the Character List and bounces it around the menu!! >w< C-Left/Right to move icons around, /char-select-bouncy-icons to toggle the add-on

Requires [Character Select](https://github.com/Squishy6094/character-select-coop) v1.8 or higher
